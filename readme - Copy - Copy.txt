THE REPO GRAPH IS WORKING 

THE SOLUTION WAS AS FOLLOWS:

GIT CONFIG --GLOBAL --REPLACE-ALL USER.EMAIL "ABOUFAKHERJ@GMAIL.COM"

THIS DID NOT WORK AN DID NOT REPLACE ANYTHING

THIS COMMAND GAVE AN EMPTY OUTPUT :

GIT CONFIG --GLOBAL USER.EMAIL


SO THE FINAL SOLUTION WAS:

GIT CONFIG --GLOBAL --ADD USER.EMAIL "ABOUFAKHERJ@GMAIL.COM"


METIONING THAT THE EMAIL WAS ALREADY ADDED TO THE REPOSITORY
IT APPEARED IN THE PROFILE SETTINGS BEFORE ADDING IT AGAIN!
